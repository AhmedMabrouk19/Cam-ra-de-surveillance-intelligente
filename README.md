# Caméra de surveillance intelligente 
---
**I - Features 🔧**

- Motion Detection 🕵️‍♂️ 
- Face Detection 😎 
- Automatic email alert with screenshot as attachment 📩 
- Works with video uploaded to Google Colab 🧪 
- Sends alerts every 60 seconds max to avoid spamming ⏱️

**II - How it Works ⚙️**

1) Upload a video using Google Colab
2) Frames are processed in real-time
3) If movement is detected → a green rectangle is drawn
4) If a face is detected within that zone → a blue rectangle appears
5) An email is automatically sent with a screenshot attached
6) The system waits 60 seconds before sending another alert (to avoid flooding your inbox)
