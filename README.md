**I - Features 🔧**

- Motion Detection 🕵️‍♂️ 
- Face Detection 😎 
- Automatic email alert with screenshot as attachment 📩 
- Works with video uploaded to Google Colab 🧪 
- Sends alerts every 60 seconds max to avoid spamming ⏱️ 

---
**II - How it Works ⚙️**

1) Upload a video using Google Colab
2) Frames are processed in real-time
3) If movement is detected → a green rectangle is drawn
4) If a face is detected within that zone → a blue rectangle appears
5) An email is automatically sent with a screenshot attached
6) The system waits 60 seconds before sending another alert (to avoid flooding your inbox)

**III - Installation & Setup 🛠️**



``!pip install imutils``



---
**IV - How to Get Your Own App Passwords 📍**

Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security

Turn on 2-Step Verification if it’s not enabled.

Scroll down and click on App passwords.

Choose the app (e.g., “Mail”) and device (e.g., “Python script”) and click Generate.

Google will give you a 16-character password like yours: ``xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx``

Copy it once  (it won’t show again!!)
